## Installation
`pip install chaipy`

## Getting Started
1. Visit [Chai](https://chai.ml/) and download the Chai app on your iPhone or Android device. 
2. Visit [Chai Developer Platform](https://chai.ml/dev).
3. Sign in.
4. Scroll to the bottom to see your "Developer Unique ID" (referred to as `developer_uid` in this tutorial) and your "Developer Key".
5. Git clone this starter repo. `git clone https://github.com/chai-nexus/chai_quickstart.git`

## Setting your DEVELOPER_KEY and DEVELOPER_UID
1. `cd chai_quickstart`
2. Open the file `uploader.py` using your text editor.

```python

DEVELOPER_UID = None # SET THIS VALUE
DEVELOPER_KEY = None # SET THIS VALUE

if DEVELOPER_KEY is None or DEVELOPER_UID is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Please fetch your UID and KEY from the bottom of the Chai Developer Platform. https://chai.ml/dev")

```

3. You must set your `DEVELOPER_UID` and `DEVELOPER_KEY`. Save and exit this file.
4. Let‚Äôs take a look at our starter bot in the file `starter_bot.py` and set our first message. Change "Hi I‚Äôm an ExampleBot" to "I love AI" then save and exit the file.
```python
from chai_py import ChaiBot, Update

class Bot(ChaiBot):
    def setup(self):
        self.logger.info("Setting up...")

    async def on_message(self, update: Update) -> str:
        return "Hi, I'm ExampleBot." # EDIT THIS MESSAGE
```

5. Now lets upload our bot! Simply run `python uploader.py`.
6. Press Y when prompted, as this is a new bot. Next time we will press N.
7. You‚Äôll get a QR code. First install the Chai app, and then scan the QR code. This will allow you to open the app so you can speak to your chat AI.
8. Chat with your bot! 

## Testing
### Chatting with your Chai

```python
from chai_py import TRoom

t_room = TRoom([Bot()])
t_room.chat()
```

```python
from chai_py import TRoom

t_room = TRoom([Bot()])
input = ["Hey", "What's up?", "What's your name?"]
t_room.test.test_chat(input)
print(t_room.messages)
for message in t_room.messages:
    print(message.content)
```

### Packaging

Next, we‚Äôll package the bot into a zip archive to prepare for upload.

```python
from chai_py import Metadata, package
from chai_py import set_auth
from starter_bot import Bot

# You'll get these from the chai developer platform: https://chai.ml/dev
DEVELOPER_UID = None
DEVELOPER_KEY = None

set_auth(DEVELOPER_UID, DEVELOPER_KEY)

BOT_IMAGE_URL = "https://cutt.ly/lx0gnM9"
package(
    Metadata(
        name="Your First Bot! üéâ ü§ñ",
        image_url=BOT_IMAGE_URL,
        color="f1a2b3",
        description="Thank you for creating me ‚ù§Ô∏è",
        input_class=Bot,
     )
)
```

### Deploying and uploading

Now, we‚Äôll upload to the Chai app! From there, you and other users can chat to it.

```python
from chai_py import upload_and_deploy, wait_for_deployment
from chai_py import share_bot

bot_uid = upload_and_deploy("_package.zip")

wait_for_deployment(bot_uid)
share_bot(bot_uid)
```

Scan the QR code. This will open the Chai app so you can speak to your chat AI.
